# SpuR - A system for spectral signature recognition of chipless RFID tags using Software-Defined Radio

In search of solutions for the problems related to Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and the development of new technologies and applications with chipless RFID tags, this article presents the development of an RFID tag reading system based on Software-Defined Radio. SpuR proposes the spectral signature reading method for chipless tags, using low cost hardware and operating in a wide frequency range, it is capable of reading different types of chipless tags and correctly identify them from a previous database stored.
