# SpuR - A Spectral Signature Reader System for Chipless Tags Using Software-Defined Radio (SDR)

In search of solutions for problems related to RFID and the development of new technologies and applications with RFID Chipless Tags. This article proposes the development of a new RFID tag reading system based on Software Defined Radios. SpuR, proposes the method of reading the spectral signature for Chipless tags, using low cost hardware, acting in a wide frequency range is able to read different types of chipless tags and correctly identify them from a previously stored database.
